# Task

Identify "anchor points" in a seminar session focused on personal development.
These are statements that can be deeply meditated upon, grappled with, and engaged with moment by moment,
in a way that can start to open up the world of the seminar.

## Instructions

1. **Input**: You will be provided with the transcript of a seminar session.
2. **Output**: Extract key statements that serve as "anchor points" for personal development.
3. **Criteria for Anchor Points**:
    - The statement should provoke deep thought or reflection.
    - It should be relevant to personal growth and development.
    - It should be engaging and capable of being pondered over time.
    - It should be "actionable" in the sense that it suggests a practice or an ongoing inquiry in approaching life.

## Example
